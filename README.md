## Introduction

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to model complex patterns in data. This series will guide you through various deep learning topics, providing hands-on coding examples and practical insights.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to install Python on your machine. We recommend using Anaconda to manage packages and environments.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/voyager2005/deep-learning-series.git
   cd deep-learning-series
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

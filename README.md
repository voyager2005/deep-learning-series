## Introduction

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that focuses on using neural networks to recognize complex patterns in data. Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain, designed to learn from large amounts of information. In this series, weâ€™ll explore different deep-learning topics, providing hands-on coding examples and practical insights to help you understand and apply these concepts effectively.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to install Python on your machine. We recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to manage packages and environments.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/voyager2005/deep-learning-series.git
   cd deep-learning-series
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Getting Started

Each article in this series will include Jupyter Notebooks and code examples. You can run the notebooks locally or in an online environment like Google Colab

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook for the corresponding article:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to implement the concepts discussed in the articles.

# Libraries for Visual Demonstration of Neural Networks

## 1. TensorBoard
- **Description**: A visualization tool that comes with TensorFlow, TensorBoard helps visualize neural network architectures, monitor training metrics, and view activations.
- **Usage**: Ideal for logging metrics during training and visualizing model performance and architecture.
- **Documentation**: [TensorBoard Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)
- **Tutorial**: [Getting Started with TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started)

## 2. Keras Visualization Toolkit
- **Description**: Tools like `plot_model` in Keras allow you to visualize the architecture of your Keras models.
- **Usage**: Provides a simple way to visualize your model structure as a graph.
- **Documentation**: [Keras Model Visualization](https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/)
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from keras.utils import plot_model
  plot_model(model, to_file='model.png', show_shapes=True)
  
## 3. Visdom
- **Description**: Developed by Facebook, Visdom is a flexible visualization tool for machine learning projects that can plot metrics in real time.
- **Usage**: Good for creating interactive visualizations to track model performance during training.
- **Documentation**: [Visdom Documentation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom)
- **Getting Started**: [Visdom Quick Start](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom#quick-start)
  
## 4. Netron
- **Description**: A viewer for neural network models. It supports various model formats (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.) and visualizes the architecture.
- **Usage**: Useful for inspecting models after theyâ€™ve been built or exported.
- **Website**: [Netron](https://netron.app/)

## 5. Deep Visualization Toolbox
- **Description**: An open-source tool for visualizing CNNs as they process images.
- **Usage**: Allows you to see which parts of an image activate certain neurons in the network.
- **GitHub Repository**: [Deep Visualization Toolbox](https://github.com/yosinski/deep-visualization-toolbox)

## 6. Lucid
- **Description**: A library for visualizing neural networks, especially focused on interpreting and understanding their behavior through activations and gradients.
- **Usage**: Great for exploring the features learned by different layers in neural networks.
- **GitHub Repository**: [Lucid](https://github.com/ChrisCummins/Lucid)

## 7. Plotly
- **Description**: While not specifically for neural networks, Plotly is a powerful library for creating interactive plots, which can be useful for visualizing metrics and results from neural networks.
- **Usage**: Can be used to visualize training history, confusion matrices, etc.
- **Documentation**: [Plotly Python](https://plotly.com/python/)
